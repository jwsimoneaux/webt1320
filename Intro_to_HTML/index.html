<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Joshua and Samantha met in Midland, TX while both were working in the oil field. When they both approached one another
 on a birthday party for the both of them, jaws dropped to the floor when they realized each others ages! But from that 
 moment on, the age difference that was not even a thing. Joshua proposed to Samantha late afternoon on March 4, 2020 
 from the comfort of their home after Joshua's neck surgery. Joshua didn't want to wait another day without asking and 
 Samantha had a hunch and was bound to push question out. Shortly after announcing their engagement to friends and family,
  Covid-19 had hit the United States and Joshua and Samantha were laid off from the oil field only for a new adventure 
  to come.</p>

   <hr>
   <p>They both nestled down in Chattanooga, TN where their lives had completely done a one-eighty. They both were 
  bound and driven for a fresh start and began attending school through a local community college and had began making 
  so many wonderful friends along the way. After over two years of living in Tennessee, their final destination was to 
  move back to Texas where they both love to be. Now living north of Dallas, the adventure continues on with the planning
   of a wedding, a graduation and a drive into their careers with not only each other but their two four legged children 
   Charlie and Daisy as well. There is so much set into the future for Samantha and Joshua but only together can they 
   accomplish this, and together they will do just that and more.</p>
